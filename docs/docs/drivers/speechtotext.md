# Speech to text

Experimental driver that listens to a (browser) mic and does speech to text. Works locally and is not too bad (not as accurate as Google's cloud version, but good enough to have fun with. This relies on: [https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT-examples](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT-examples) which is installed on the Lenovo, and install instructions can be found in README.md
