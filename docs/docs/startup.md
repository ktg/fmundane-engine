# Caravan startup

Once you have booted up there are a few things you will need to do before running an experience.

1. Get speech working: Check that the Apple Mac is on â€“ this handles speech; to date Apple's 'say' command line has the best local text to speech we have found.
2. Press F11 to minimise the browser. Get sound working: Go to settings, sound and click line out and select the Sound Blaster option.
3. Get media playing: Before media can autoplay in Chrome, Chrome needs to have seen some user interaction with the browser. You need to click on the browser screen (i.e. the future mundane logo) in order for media to subsequently autoplay.
