# Things that will annoy you

1. Make sure mqtt is running - if not events will not fire
2. Make sure that the IPs.txt and actions.json files (under server/src/actions) reflect the correct IPS of the devices in the caravan
3. Check that the IPs referred to in qrcode actions are correct (i.e. that they point to the future mundane engine machine)
4. If events do not fire, it may be because the calls to the urls are not working (i.e. driver is not working or IP address is wrong - check these first)
5. Check that the machine that is running the 'wizard of oz' interface is on the caravan network
6. Check that the machine running this (future mundane engine) code is on the caravan network
7. TURN the mac on to do speech
8. Check sound - make sure that the future mundane machine output settings (top right menu -> settings -> sound) is set to the soundblaster card
9. If media does not display on the screen it will probably becuase it needs to be clicked (just once) to demonstrate user interaction (a chrome feature to prevent media from autoplaying without permission from users)
