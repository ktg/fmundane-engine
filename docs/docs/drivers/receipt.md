# Reciept driver
There is no node receipt driver code. The code runs off the PI and can be called as follows:

| **endpoint** | **method** | **description** | **params** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /print | GET | print a line of text | **text:** the text to print |

There is a README.md in the receipt\_driver directory that shows the steps required to get the (now unsupported) receipt printer working on the Pi.
