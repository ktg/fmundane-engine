# Dyson fan

### Dyson fan not responding

Check that the fan is on. If it is not on, but was, it may have cut out, either when it tried to turn and got obstructed by something or when it was used as a heater and tripped the system. We have sometimes found that simply turning the fan off and on again has made it behave!
